      "text": "As part of this graphic identity, I have made the strategic decision to opt for a color palette composed of two distinct shades to create a strong and memorable visual impact. Specifically for the logo, I have chosen to combine a vibrant and energetic orange with a soft and subtle pastel pink. The use of orange in the logo brings a touch of vitality, dynamism, and optimism. This bright color evokes energy, creativity, and boldness, creating a positive and impactful impression. It instantly grabs the viewer's attention and elicits a sense of enthusiasm and confidence. On the other hand, the pastel pink balances the overall composition by adding a dimension of delicacy, harmony, and femininity. This subtle and soothing shade conveys gentleness, elegance, and tenderness. It creates a welcoming and warm atmosphere, reinforcing the brand's friendly aspect. By combining these two complementary colors, I aimed to create an interesting visual contrast that captures attention while offering a balanced aesthetic. The vibrant orange stands out in comparison to the pastel pink, creating a striking visual contrast.",

      "text": "For the creation of this logo, I opted for a creative approach by skillfully merging the initials of the project, namely the \"G\" and the \"A\". This strategic decision was made with the purpose of elegantly and distinctively representing the very essence of the project. By combining the two letters, I sought to create a harmonious visual synergy that embodies both the identity and values of the brand. The subtle integration of the \"G\" and the \"A\" generates a new, unique, and recognizable graphic shape that becomes the visual symbol of the company. This fusion of initials also reflects unity and cohesion, symbolizing the collective and collaborative nature of the project. It reinforces the idea of a solid and unified entity, ready to face challenges and stand out in its field. By using this fusion technique, I aimed to bring a touch of creativity and originality to the logo while maintaining optimal readability and clarity. The combination of shapes creates a captivating visual that grabs attention and remains easily memorable for clients and users.",

The mascot becomes an iconic character that embodies the values, spirit, and activities of Graph'Arts studio. Choosing a small character as the mascot helps establish an emotional connection with the target audience. This cartoon-like character evokes cheerfulness, creativity, and a friendly atmosphere. It becomes the visual representative of the company, offering a likable and engaging presence in visual communications. This mascot can be used in various ways within the graphic identity.
